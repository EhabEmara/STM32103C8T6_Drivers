 # STM32103C8T6_Drivers
// Testing Interrupt Driver of STM32103C8T6 Microcontroller Based ARM Cortex-M3 and applying the concept of external interrupts priority , I made 3 external interrupts , one of them is located into the highest priority group and the others are located into a lower group with different sub priorites , so the highest priority interrupt when getting excuted it can't be interrupted by the 2 other interrupts ..
